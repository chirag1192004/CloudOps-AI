# CloudOps-AI

🚀 CloudOps AI: Enterprise Multi-Cloud Intelligence PlatformCloudOps AI is an enterprise-grade, autonomous governance system designed to unify infrastructure management across AWS, Azure, and GCP. It utilizes a sophisticated 8-model AI pipeline to solve cloud waste, security vulnerabilities, and fragmented visibility.💡 Executive SummaryOrganizations currently waste 30-40% of their cloud budget on idle resources and suffer from reactive security postures due to fragmented visibility across providers. CloudOps AI provides a unified intelligence layer that automates cost forecasting, anomaly detection, and resource optimization using a specialized ensemble of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning models.🏗️ The VisionModern cloud management shouldn't be a manual task. Our vision is to transform cloud operations into an autonomous utility that:Self-Forecasts: Achieves 92%+ budget accuracy.Self-Heals: Automatically remediates configuration drifts.Self-Optimizes: Executes "Zombie Resource" termination and right-sizing without human intervention.Converses: Allows engineers to query infrastructure state using Natural Language.🧠 System ArchitectureThe platform follows a Microservices Architecture orchestrated via Kubernetes, ensuring that high-intensity AI inference tasks can scale independently from data ingestion services.Client Layer: React 18 SPA with WebSocket integration for real-time telemetry.Processing Layer: 10+ FastAPI microservices (Resource, Forecast, Anomaly, Recommendation, etc.).Event Bus: Kafka/RabbitMQ for decoupled, event-driven communication.Intelligence Layer: A dedicated ML Engine serving an ensemble of 8 specialized models via TensorFlow Serving.🧩 Planned AI Engine (8-Model Pipeline)CloudOps AI avoids the "one-size-fits-all" approach by utilizing specialized models for specific cloud challenges:ModelArchitecturePurposeCost ForecasterBidirectional LSTM30-90 day time-series cost prediction.Anomaly DetectorDeep AutoencoderUnsupervised behavior-based threat/spike detection.Policy OptimizerQ-Learning (RL)Learning optimal scaling and termination policies.Intent ClassifierFine-tuned BERTTranslating natural language queries to API calls.Entity ExtractorBiLSTM + CRFIdentifying regions, providers, and resources in text.Seasonality EngineFB ProphetDetecting weekly/monthly expenditure patterns.Zombie HunterRandom ForestClassifying idle vs. active resources with high precision.Design AnalyzerResNet50 (CNN)Analyzing infrastructure diagrams for pattern recognition.📊 Data Modalities & IntegrationThe system normalizes disparate data streams into a unified schema:Inventory Metadata: Resource configurations and lifecycle states via Boto3 (AWS), Azure SDK, and GCP Client Libraries.Time-Series Metrics: CPU, Memory, Disk, and Network telemetry stored in TimescaleDB.Billing Data: Real-time spend and historical cost exports.Unstructured Logs: Security events and audit trails managed via MongoDB and the ELK Stack.🧰 Tech StackBackend: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Celery, SQLAlchemy.Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zustand, TanStack Query.AI/ML: TensorFlow, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, MLflow.Data: PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka.DevOps: Docker, Kubernetes (EKS/AKS/GKE), Terraform, GitHub Actions.📂 Implementation Roadmap📍 Phase 1 (Foundation): Project initialization, Multi-Cloud SDK integration, and Unified Data Modeling. [Current]Phase 2 (Intelligence): ML Model training, hyperparameter tuning, and MLflow registry setup.Phase 3 (Microservices): Core API development, WebSocket implementation, and Dashboard UI.Phase 4 (Production): Kubernetes orchestration, Terraform IaC, and security hardening.🛠️ Local Development Setup (Alpha)Clone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/cloudops-ai.git
